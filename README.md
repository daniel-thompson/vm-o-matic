vm-o-matic - Simple, semi-automatic QEMU recipes
================================================

vm-o-matic isn't clever, complete or scaleable. However it *is*
useful if you want to spin up a throwaway VM to test out something
about a specific distro.

Example
-------

```sh
cd debian-11-bullseye-amd64
make help
make install
make
```
